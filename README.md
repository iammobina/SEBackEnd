# Travel And Tourism Backend

This repository contains my project for the Software Engineering Course at Iran University of Science and Technology.

The project contains all the codes that are necessary for developing backend of a website
including connecting to a database , save information , authentication check and etc.


This project is restful which means that the code on the client side can be changed at any time without affecting the operation of the server, and the code on the server side can be changed without affecting the operation of the client.


In this project, the main idea is to implement a website that provides comprehensive information about different places for tourists. There are two types of users in this project. The first is the normal user, or tourist, and the second is the tour guide.

A tour guide can set a plan for visiting a place on a calendar with several details about that place, then normal users can compare the plans from all the tour guides and as soon as they discover the best program, they can become a member of the team and travel! 


## Language

The Project is written in python(django rest framework).
